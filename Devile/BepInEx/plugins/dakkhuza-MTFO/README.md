# Mod the FUCK out

A bepinex plugin that saves / loads the internal configuration files (hereafter refered to as "Data Blocks") as raw json files.

MTFO also adds it's own custom configuration files, these should be placed under

```
GTFO/
└──BepInEx/
    └──plugins/
        └──RundownName/
            ├──GameData_*.json
            └──custom/
                └──CustomFiles
```

The custom folder is **not** created by default and must be manually created by the developer.

Documentation on MTFO and the Custom folder can be found on the wiki [here](https://gtfo-modding.gitbook.io/wiki/).

## Installing

### Easy

1. Download [R2ModMan](https://gtfo.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
2. Search for MTFO and install it with dependencies
3. Launch modded, you're done!

---

### Manual

Download and install [BepInEx](https://gtfo.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_GTFO/).

If you don't know how to find your GTFO folder

Steam library -> Right click GTFO -> Properties -> View local files

![The first step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTFO-Modding/MTFO/main/images/1.png)

![The second step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTFO-Modding/MTFO/main/images/2.png)

![The third step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTFO-Modding/MTFO/main/images/3.png)

After following the BepInEx installation instructions and **launching the game at least once** place MTFO into your plugins folder.

```
GTFO/
└──BepInEx/
    └──plugins/
          └──MTFO.dll
```

Launch the game once more, your file structure should now look similar to this

```
GTFO/
├──BepInEx/
|    ├──config/
|    |     ├──_gameDataLookup
|    |     ├──BepInEx.cfg
|    |     └──MTFO.cfg
|    └──plugins/
|          ├──MTFO.dll
|          └──GameData_XXXXX
├──mono/
├──doorstop_config.ini
├──GTFO.exe
└──winhttp.dll
```

## Installing Rundowns

# Easy

1. Download [R2ModMan](https://gtfo.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
2. Create a [new profile](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/wiki/Profiles)
3. Find and install the rundown you'd like to play and install it with dependencies
4. Launch modded

You're done!

---

# Manual

1. Download the rundown you'd like to play
2. Place the rundown under GTFO/BepInEx/Plugins
   - Make sure to check if the rundown you're installing has extra install steps! These will usually be in a "README.txt" or "INSTALLATION.txt" file.

```
GTFO/
└──BepInEx/
     └──plugins/
           └──RundownName/
```

3. Download and install any dependencies the rundown may have.
4. Launch the game!



### ! Warning !

If you have more than one rundown inside the plugin folder at the same time, whichever rundown is discovered first will be loaded.
- Make sure to uninstall any plugins not related to the rundown you have installed, otherwise there might be issues or crashes!

# Patch notes
- 4.6.2
    * Fixed a NRE from DiscordManager on expedition success/fail (Thanks hirnukuono!)
    * You can just ping me for these things instead of saying someone should update it for months
- 4.6.1
    * MTFO now actually disables achievements, you can turn this off in the config (thanks again flow)
    * Fixed this readme being all fucky wucky
- 4.6.0
    * MTFO (should) now disable achievements by default, this can be changed in the config. This is to stop achievements unlocking under unintended conditions when playing certain custom rundowns (e.g. lockout 3)
- 4.5.2
    * Version bump
    * Thunderstore package now matches internal version again
- 4.4.5
    * Fixed issue with matchmaking button

    * Previous patch is thanks to flow aria!
- 4.4.0
    * Removed lookup table / hashing
    * GameData is now dumped to `BepInEx/GameData-Dump/[revision]`
    * Dumping data needs to be turned on in config
    * MTFO will only load included files. For instance, if you do not included the `TextDataBlock` in your rundown dist, MTFO will load the vanilla version and will not auto-generate a dump file. In short: you will no longer need to update files you don't edit when the game updates.

- 4.3.9
    * Re-compiled against latest game version
