# AdvancedWardenObjective

This mod is a fork of Flowaria's AdvancedWardenObjective ([AWO_Testing](https://thunderstore.io/c/gtfo/p/GTFOModding/AWO_Testing/)) with a few hotfixes since R8, new features, and nearly twice as many warden events.  

This is a full AWO_Testing compile with a +X version bump, so it won't cause any issues if both are present in your profile. Bepinex will load and use the newest version, but it's recommended to uninstall the OG AWO.

All credit goes to Flowaria for his breathtaking work on GTFO. We miss you and wish you the best in all aspects of life.

## Features
 - Over 50 new warden events.
 - Two vanilla event overrides.
 - Custom success screen support.
 - Terminal serial number lookups.

 - AWO will be soon entering a "finished" state, and will not be receving anymore major updates beyond bug fixes.
 - If you are using Partial Data, please use [Hirnu's fork.](https://thunderstore.io/c/gtfo/p/hirnukuono/AWOPartialDataFixer/)
 - AWO makes use of `GTFO.API`, so it is incompatible with VR. There is no planned support for VR.
