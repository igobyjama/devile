# AdvancedWardenObjective

This mod is a fork of Flowaria's AdvancedWardenObjective ([AWO_Testing](https://thunderstore.io/c/gtfo/p/GTFOModding/AWO_Testing/)) with a few hotfixes since R8, new features, and nearly twice as many warden events.  

This is a full AWO_Testing compile with a +X version bump, so it won't cause any issues if both are present in your profile. BepInEx will load and use the newest version, but it's recommended to uninstall the OG AWO.

All credit goes to Flowaria for their breathtaking work on GTFO.

## Features
- Over 50 new warden events.
- Four vanilla event overrides.
- Custom success screen support.
- Terminal serial number lookups.
